## Introduction

The ESP Azure OPTIGA™ Trust M package is based on Azure IoT C SDK and allows to connect Espressif ESP32 based devices to the Azure IoT hub using OPTIGA™ Trust M security chip for X.509 based security in Azure IoT hub. It provides some examples which can help to understand most common use cases.

This Application Note uses Espressif ESP32, but it also shows how to port onto another host platform. You can find more information [below](PortingGuide.md) 

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Download and install missing components 

1. **ESP-IDF ver. 4.1** .ESP IDF stands for Espressif IoT Development Framework. The installation guidelines based on you setup can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step). Please try to build a sample ["Hello World"](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-5-start-a-project) project before continuing.

2. **This repository**
  ``` bash
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/Infineon/azure-optiga-trust-m3.git
  ```

## Step 2. Setting up Microsoft Azure IoT Hub

### Create an IoT Hub using the Azure portal

- Create an account and get an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) if you do not have an Azure subscription already.
- Create an Azure IoT Hub by following the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal#create-an-iot-hub).

> **Note: When selecting the "Pricing and scale tier", there is also an option to select , F1: Free tier, which should be sufficient for basic evaluation.**

### Create a CA certificate for Azure IoT Hub

[This](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-security-x509-get-started#get-x509-ca-certificates) section of the MS Azure IoT tutorial describes generic difference between different type of supported crednetials:
```
The X.509 certificate-based security in the IoT Hub requires you to start with an X.509 certificate chain, which includes the root certificate as well as any intermediate certificates up until the leaf certificate.

You may choose any of the following ways to get your certificates:

1. Purchase X.509 certificates from a root certificate authority (CA). This method is recommended for production environments.

2. Create your own X.509 certificates using a third-party tool such as OpenSSL. This technique is fine for test and development purposes. See Managing test CA certificates for samples and tutorials for information about generating test CA certificates using PowerShell or Bash. The rest of this tutorial uses test CA certificates generated by following the instructions in Managing test CA certificates for samples and tutorials.

3. Generate an X.509 intermediate CA certificate signed by an existing root CA certificate and upload it to the hub. Once the intermediate certificate is uploaded and verified, as instructed below, it can be used in the place of a root CA certificate mentioned below. Tools like OpenSSL (openssl req and openssl ca) can be used to generate and sign an intermediate CA certificate.
```
The OPTIGA Trust M board comes with a [pre-provisioned unique X.509 certificate](https://github.com/Infineon/optiga-trust-m/tree/master/certificates), which correspond to the first option, but for testing we advice to provision a new test X.509 certificate **to the secure element** uwing a third-party tool such as OpenSSL.

For this please follow first **three** steps from the [guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/master/tools/CACertificates/CACertificateOverview.md), namelly "Step 1 - Initial Setup", and "Step 2 - Create the certificate chain", and "Step 3 - Proof of Possession".

Now it becomes possible to provision your device with a new X.509 certificate and create a new Azure IoT Device.

### Creating a new Azure IoT Device

- Create an Azure IoT Hub by following steps under section **Create an X.509 device for your IoT hub** from the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-security-x509-get-started#create-an-x509-device-for-your-iot-hub).
- Note down newly created IoT Device **Device ID** 

### Creating a test X.509 device certificate

- Go to windows start menu and Open ESP-IDF command prompt

        C:\Users\username\Desktop\esp-idf\tools
    
    Checking if Python packages are up to date...
    Python requirements from C:\Users\username\Desktop\esp-idf\requirements.txt are satisfied.
    
    Done! You can now compile ESP-IDF projects.
    Go to the project directory and run:
    
    idf.py build
    
    
    C:\Users\username\Desktop\esp-idf>
    ```
    </details>
- Change working directory to <azure-optiga-trust-m\examples\provision_test_certificate>
- Configure "OPTIGA(TM) Trust M config" using below command to select the Certificate and Key slot

    ```sh
    idf.py menuconfig
    ```
- Build Personalisation project and Flash ESP32 using below command 
    ```bash	
    idf.py build
    idf.py -p <ESP32 serial port> flash
        E.g.: idf.py -p com7 flash

    //Custom build folder
    idf.py -B <CUSTOM_BUILD_FOLDER_PATH> build    
    idf.py -B <CUSTOM_BUILD_FOLDER_PATH> -p <ESP32 serial port> flash
    E.g. : idf.py -B c:\esp-build build
         : idf.py -B c:\esp-build -p com7 flash
    ```
- Once sample project is flashed successfully, you can monitor communication between ESP32 using
    ```sh
    idf.py monitor
    ```
- Choose the type of private key pair to be personalized by selecting from the given option shown below
	```bash
	Press 1 to Generate NIST P-256
	Press 2 to Generate NIST P-384
	Press 3 to Generate NIST P-521
	Press 4 to Generate Brainpool 256 r1
	Press 5 to Generate Brainpool 384 r1
	Press 6 to Generate Brainpool 512 r1
	Press 7 to Generate RSA 1024
	Press 8 to Generate RSA 2048
	```

* Public Key Extraction</br>
  The demo project starts with generating a new keypair, where the private part stays on the secure element, and the public component   is printed out. You should be able to see something like this
  ```bash
  Device public key:
  -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
  MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEzWVpzrgbuR5yM5/oz2DvD5+0czOs
  bxkYE2mZP6DCk1+uCPEa0EG3NFznRhBGIo5aX9eH1XHcsk6NdbMlhuLMDA==
  -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  ```
  Copy the lines of key into a file called `device_public_key.pem`.
* Public Key Infrastructure Setup</br>
  If you have completed [this](#Create-a-CA-certificate-for-Azure-IoT-Hub) step, you should have either `.\RootCA.pem` in Windows or `./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem` in Bash.
  Now type in the following command using OpenSSL:
  ```bash
  //For RSA key generation execute below command
  openssl genrsa -out tempCsrSigner.key 2048
  or
  //For ECC key generation execute below command
  openssl ecparam -out tempCsrSigner.pem -name prime256v1 -genkey

  openssl req -new -key tempCsrSigner.key -out deviceCert.csr
  ```
  During execution of second command, You will be prompted to give Distinguished Names(DN). Common Name (CN) is mandatory field in DN details. Provide the newly created Azure IoT Device  **DEVICE ID** as common name for csr generation, other fields can be skipped</br>
  For Bash
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -req -in deviceCert.csr -CA ./certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem -CAkey ./private/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem -CAcreateserial -out deviceCert.pem -days 500 -sha256 -force_pubkey device_public_key.pem 
  ```
  For Powershell
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -req -in deviceCert.csr -CA .\certs\azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem -CAkey .\private\azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem -CAcreateserial -out deviceCert.pem -days 500 -sha256 -force_pubkey device_public_key.pem
  ```
* Writing back the new certificate
	- Open the the certficate file in any text editor and copy the certificate.
	- Edit the main file of the "provision_test_certificate" project from the path <azure-optiga-trust-				m\examples\provision_test_certificate\main>.
	- Replace the "CERTIFICATE" macro value "0" with the copied certficate. 
	- Build Personalisation project and Flash ESP32 using below command 
	    ```bash	
	    idf.py build
	    idf.py -p <ESP32 serial port> flash
		E.g.: idf.py -p com7 flash

	    //Custom build folder
	    idf.py -B <CUSTOM_BUILD_FOLDER_PATH> build    
	    idf.py -B <CUSTOM_BUILD_FOLDER_PATH> -p <ESP32 serial port> flash
	    E.g. : idf.py -B c:\esp-build build
		 : idf.py -B c:\esp-build -p com7 flash
	    ```
	- Once sample project is flashed successfully, you can monitor communication between ESP32 using
	    ```sh
	    idf.py monitor
	    ```
	- After the above step, Certficate will be succesfully written to selected certficate slot.

## Step 3. Configuring and Building Sample

- Follow this step only if Server root CA need to be loaded into any of OPTIGA data object.This certficate will be used for Authentication in TLS session. 
    - Comment the macro **-DMBEDTLS_RSA_ALT** from the Cmakelist.txt file present in the path <azure-optiga-trust-m\components\optiga> as shown below
        ```sh
        #-DMBEDTLS_RSA_ALT
        ```
        >Note: Since OPTIGA™ Trust M supports only RSA 1024/2048 and Azure Certificate chain has RSA 4096 certificate, the certificate path validation cannot be performed using OPTIGA™ Trust M RSA feature. Hence usage of RSA feature from OPTIGA™ Trust M need to be disabled. 
    - Enable the macro **SET_TRUSTED_CERT_IN_SAMPLES** and **LOAD_TA_FROM_OPTIGA** from the Cmakelist.txt file present in the path <azure-optiga-trust-m2\examples\iothub_client_sample_mqtt\main> by uncommenting the compile time definitions as below.
        ```sh
        component_compile_definitions(SET_TRUSTED_CERT_IN_SAMPLES)
        component_compile_definitions(LOAD_TA_FROM_OPTIGA)
        ```
    - To enable server certficate validation using OPTIGA, the region specific server root CA certificate must be loaded in any of OPTIGA data object either by personalization or by writing to object using OPTIGA write API
    - To load trust anchor using OPTIGA write API, modify file <azure-optiga-trust-m\components\optiga\optiga-trust-m\examples\utilities\optiga_trust.c> as below
        - User can choose the root CA as either from the below available certificate or can provide specific certificate by setting value as "1". E.g.:  #if 1
        By default user can select the **DigiCert Baltimore Root** certificate as it is used Globally as Root Server CA.

## Troubleshooting
<a name="troubleshooting"></a>

1. Some common problems can be fixed by disabling the firewall.

2. You can try with the followings, if your build fails:
	- `git submodule update --init --recursive`
	- Check the compiler version and verify that it is the correct one for your ESP IDF version.
	- Check if the IDF_PATH is set correctly
	- Clean the project with “idf.py fullclean” or for custom build with “idf.py -B <CUSTOM_BUILD_FOLDER_PATH> fullclean”
3. Ensure that the device connection string received from Azure IoT Hub are correct.
